# Github Buddy - In-Progress (Feb 13 - Present)

A platform for monitoring your repositories and teams, keeping track of bugs, and viewing contribution across users. Sign up, create a project, add your team members, and get to work.

## About Github Buddy:
Github Buddy aims to focus on repository management and team collaboration, and will allow users to create an account, link their github, add repositories, and view/manage their projects.  From there, users can view and manage issues, see recent changes, and monitor who is working on what.
